In addition to things that will (hopefully someday) become papers, presentations, or published work, I will also post transcriptions of presentations and the occasional curricular framework here. I don't really want this space to end up soaking up curation work from me--I am not trying to make this blog generate any sort of passive income or anything like that. I'm hosting it for free on GitHub, and all the content on it will always be open-source and licensed for free to anyone who wants to use it (as long as you are not a giant technology company); as such, it will remain minimalistic, low-maintenance, and rather uncurated. I might change my mind about that, but for now that's the policy.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=i.exports}}]);
