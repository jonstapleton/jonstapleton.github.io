The point of a curriculum is for it to be repeatable, shippable, sharable, and to minimize unreliable or ephemeral dependencies. The problem is that these tightly-sequenced curricula don't reflect my personal learning experiences, nor do they reflect the types of learning that I observe most frequently in real life. How can I use a curriculum like that when my students are changing every year? When my students are changing <em>every day</em>? When <em>I</em> am changing every day?</p> <h2 id="what-is-rhizomatic-learning"><a href="#what-is-rhizomatic-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Rhizomatic Learning?</h2> <p>In short, <strong>rhizomatic learning</strong> is a model of teaching and learning that values dialogue, openness, situatedness, and self-direction as opposed to hierarchies, control, and reproducibility. I think Jenny Mackness summarizes them nicely in her <a href="https://jennymackness.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/questions-about-rhizomatic-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> from 2014 where she frames rhizomatic learning as &quot;emergent&quot;, &quot;multipath&quot;, valuing autonomy and learner agency, and embracing uncertainty. Teachers who facilitate rhizomatic learning are facilitators, guides, and coaches. Learners lead the way, blazing their own paths. Rhizomatic learning is based on the philosophical work of Deleuze &amp; Guattari, who put down these ideas in their book <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>.</p> <p>What follows is my best attempt to put down some of the core ideas that guide my rhizomatic teaching practices. I hope to put forward a common lens through which we might compare and evaluate rhizomatic curricula on their own terms, rather than in opposition to what some call <strong>arborescent</strong> curricula.</p> <p>Before I get into it, I want to offer a disclaimer--I'm not going to dive into the philosophical background of the rhizome metaphor I've chosen to use. I also will not endlessly qualify the scope of my definitions as it relates to Deleuze &amp; Guattari's rendering of the rhizome in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>. That way lies madness. Just know that any rhizome I describe below is infinitely large and inter-connected and extends beyond the horizon of any boundary we draw around it. It resists diagram-ization, but this resistance will not deter me. Consider the tracing below to be necessarily incomplete. The material below is predicated on some assumptions about teaching and learning, or at least some basic tenets that I generally try to put into practice:</p> <ul><li>Learning is generative; learners make things. Think art class as opposed to a lecture hall</li> <li>Teaching is facilitative, not transmissive; think coach as opposed to lecturer</li> <li>Learners' and teachers' creative agency is the foundation of the learning/teaching process</li> <li>Learning is situated by the self and by one's singular perspective and thus is fundamentally irreplicable.</li></ul> <h2 id="mapping-as-a-teaching-learning-model"><a href="#mapping-as-a-teaching-learning-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mapping as a Teaching &amp; Learning Model</h2> <p>Imagine an infinite stretch of wilderness. I like to imagine the Appalachian mountains, which are quite close to where I am now. Now imagine this as a metaphorical space, a space representing the lands you traverse when you learn things. The act of learning in this metaphor is an act of traversal--as you journey this wilderness, you witness the things that wait for you out there. It might be useful to imagine discrete bits of skills and knowledge as locations. This metaphor is a little ham-fisted--we know that knowledge is more complex than that, surely--but I will stick with it for now.</p> <p>Teaching involves guiding people through this wilderness. You might provide them with a map showing a starting point and an ending point, or you might instead ask them to go find something worth seeing on their own. You might decide that it's best to keep everyone together, or you might decide to let everyone find their own way. In this way, teachers take on different personas as they work with learners: teachers might be <strong>Guides</strong>, <strong>Cartographers</strong>, <strong>Lorekeepers</strong> or one of many other possible facilitative roles.</p> <p>At this point, it's probably a good idea to lay out some terms related to the wilderness metaphor. I'm going to be using these formulations throughout, so I figured I would just catalog them here ahead of time.</p> <ul><li><strong>Location:</strong> A discrete skill or practice, something that you learn</li> <li><strong>Landmark:</strong> A location visible from a great distance; a skill or practice that you know <em>about</em> before you know it yourself</li> <li><strong>Trail:</strong> The things you do to learn something, the course you set as you journey between locations</li> <li><strong>Map:</strong> A record of the Locations you or someone else has been and the Trails they took to get there, a tracing of a Map; a &quot;sequence&quot; of learning</li> <li><strong>Territory:</strong> The stretch of land you find yourself in; a content area or domain of knowledge artificially cordoned off by arbitrary Borders</li> <li><strong>Borders:</strong> Structural or institutional barriers or demarcations around Territories imposed by an authority</li> <li><strong>Nomads:</strong> Learners traveling along Trails to different Locations</li> <li><strong>Survival Kit:</strong> The things that sustain you in your journey; the tools that facilitate learning and creativity</li></ul> <h2 id="curricular-design-in-the-rhizome"><a href="#curricular-design-in-the-rhizome" class="header-anchor">#</a> Curricular Design in the Rhizome</h2> <p>Before I continue any further, I think it's useful to think about how one might view familiar curricular design approaches through the lens of the rhizome metaphor. I worry a lot that this metaphor sometimes gets in the way, but I find it's a very useful heuristic for comparing different curricular and pedagogical approaches. Here is the familiar &quot;backwards design&quot; curricular design strategy framed by the language of the wilderness metaphor, followed by a description of rhizomatic learning using the same language.</p> <h3 id="backwards-design"><a href="#backwards-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Backwards Design</h3> <p>The &quot;backward design&quot; methodology popularized by the book <em>Understanding by Design</em> (Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 1998) starts with a <strong>Location</strong> in mind. The teacher might already have traveled one or more Trails to get to this <strong>Location</strong>; it's likely that this particular <strong>Location</strong> is familiar to the teacher (this familiarity is what we might call &quot;content area expertise&quot; outside of this metaphor). The teacher then tries to find their students at their respective <strong>Locations</strong> in the <strong>Territory</strong>, and builds <strong>Trails</strong> from the learners' <strong>Locations</strong> to the destination <strong>Location</strong>. The teacher may often frame the destination as a <strong>Landmark</strong>; even if students can't already see the <strong>Location</strong> from where they stand, teachers may try to clear some of the obstructions (trees, foliage, etc.) that stand in their way so students can see their &quot;destination&quot; before embarking on their journey. In backward design methodologies, the teacher is responsible for maintaining the trails from students' <strong>Locations</strong> to the final destination (these &quot;trails&quot; are the sequences, lesson plans, and scaffolds that help students learn the content). Once the trails are set up, the teacher guides students along their Trails. If students find themselves off the path, the teacher must go retrieve them or build a new Trail to bring them back to the well-worn <strong>Trail</strong>. At the end of the journey, everyone finds themselves together at the Landmark.</p> <h3 id="rhizomatic-learning"><a href="#rhizomatic-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Rhizomatic Learning</h3> <p>In a rhizomatic learning approach, instead of prepping the territory and cordoning off sections teachers would like students to travel through, a teacher drops students into a territory and asks them to explore. Rhizomatic learning acknowledges that parts of these territories are known to learners, having been the sites of previous excursions beyond the teachers' ken, and equally acknowledges that much of the territory is mysterious to both the students <em>and</em> the teachers. The journey begins with an acknowledgement of the <strong>Locations</strong> students have visited and the tangled <strong>Trails</strong> already visible in the territory. It also begins with goal-setting--what Landmarks can we see from where we are? Where do we want to find ourselves? Have we seen or heard of a Trail that might take us there? If not, what do we need to do to blaze a new trail? After this reflective stage, learners and teachers alike venture out into the wilderness, cataloging their encounters with things familiar and mysterious as they record their journey on a Map. The teacher's role is one of lore-keeper and cartographer; they record the stories of the <strong>Nomads</strong> journeying through the territory, and take note of the secret <strong>Trails</strong> these <strong>Nomads</strong> discover. The teacher is sometimes a guide, helping <strong>Nomads</strong> find new <strong>Trails</strong> or orient themselves to the Landmarks they are seeking. This &quot;teacher&quot; role isn't exclusive to the instructor--any <strong>Nomad</strong> may take up these responsibilities (indeed, the teacher is a <strong>Nomad</strong> themselves).</p> <h2 id="curricular-design-as-cartography"><a href="#curricular-design-as-cartography" class="header-anchor">#</a> Curricular Design as Cartography</h2> <p>I have found myself thinking about these dueling philosophies in terms of travel. Backwards design is on rails: it's fast, efficient, and inflexible. It's destination is set by it's manifest structure; once the rails are down, it takes a lot of work to change the <strong>Trail</strong> it traces. My preferred approach is more like hiking, or navigating across wilderness. There are well-worn paths I can walk down, or I can bushwack into unmapped spaces. This formulation of learning as <em>nomadic</em> and exploratory might be familiar to some, and it falls under several different labels. Astute readers may see some familiar formulations and patterns in my description of rhizomatic learning--project-based learning, inquiry-based learning, and constructionism (among others) share many of the goals of rhizomatic learning. It seeks to protect the agency of the learner, their ability to choose their own Trails and destinations. In practice, these goals are quite (quite) lofty. Backward design plays nicely with standards and values replicability; these goals are beyond the scope of a rhizomatic curriculum. This is not to say that addressing learning standards through rhizomatic pedagogy is impossible; if you conceive of standards as <strong>Locations</strong>, there's no reason why a learner wouldn't choose to visit the standard as part of their journey. The problem is, the standard has to be a <strong>Location</strong> worth visiting.</p> <p>In the interest of keeping things grounded, let's get to the point: how does one <em>teach</em> rhizomatically? Fundamentally, rhizomatic teaching is an improvisatory art, and the ingredients of good improvisation (a strong fluency in the medium/genre, rock-solid grasp of conventions and tropes, courage) are necessary here as well. Beyond these fundamental prerequisites, however, there are some strategies that I have found useful in my journey. These are the steps I have come to rely on for the practical implementation of rhizomatic pedagogy:</p> <ol><li>Acknowledge the <strong>Territory</strong></li> <li>Identify <strong>Landmarks</strong></li> <li>Acknowledge Your <strong>Role</strong></li> <li>Draw <strong>Maps</strong></li> <li>Assemble <strong>Survival Kits</strong></li> <li>Install <strong>Artifacts</strong></li> <li>Foster <strong>Wanderlust</strong></li></ol> <h1 id="what-comes-next"><a href="#what-comes-next" class="header-anchor">#</a> What Comes Next</h1> <p>The metaphor of the wilderness is (I think, at least) very helpfully illustrative of the foundational practices of rhizomatic teaching and learning. The next step is to unpack some best practices; what does it look like to put rhizomatic teaching &amp; learning into practice? What are some Trails teachers might trace as they try this sort of thing out on their own? This post has gone on long enough. This year I finally feel like I've wrapped my head around what it means for me to put rhizomatic teaching &amp; learning into practice in my classroom. In a forthcoming post, I'll unpack how I set that up.</p> <p><a href="http://jonstapleton.github.io/2021/02/21/acknowledging-the-territory/"><button type="button" class="button is-primary"><!----><span>You can read the next post, <strong>Acknowledging the Territory</strong> here ➡</span><!----></button></a></p> <hr></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
